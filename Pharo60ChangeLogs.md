# Pharo 6.0 

A large, international community of developers worked hard for several months to iron out all problems and to make Pharo 6.0 a great release. 
Pharo 6.0 saw a large set of changes, infrastructural improvements and others: more than 1400 tickets got closed. 
Our actions are targeted at building a sound infrastructure on top of which new generation of systems can be built.
Remember that Pharo is your open-source system!

## Overall

- The PharoVM and image are now provided in 64-bit version in Linux and OSX and brings even better performance and stability
- A new code changes management system named Epica for easier reviewing and recovering of your code
- Integrated support for Git and easy-to-use tool for repositories and commits management named `Iceberg` (as preview for Pharo 7)
- `Unified foreign function interface` (UFFI) for interfacing with the outside world was significantly improved
- Introduction of objects immutability, alternative bytecode sets and block closures independent on outer context 
- The whole Pharo is now able to be bootstrapped from source codes managed by Git and Pharo modularity was improved
- The `Dark Theme` was improved and set as default color theme for Pharo

## All Issues

In Pharo 6 over 1400 fixes and enhancements was integrated. The most significant are:
The complete list of fixed issues is too big to be placed here, but you can review all issues at [FogBugz issue tracker](https://pharo.fogbugz.com) (you will need an account there, sorry). 

Thank you all for your contribution.

### Tools

- `Epicea` - Code changes manager

- `GToolkit`, `GTools` update
- `Quality Assistant` improvements
- More reliable interruption by `CMD+.`
- `Playground` variables are now visible from debugger
- `Debugger` temp names mapping is fixed
- _Close all debuggers_ in taskbar context menu
- _Run To Here_ in `GTDebugger`

### VM related

- 64-bits support
- Improve host platforms management (32-bit/64-bit)

### Other

- Dark Theme improvements
- Improvement of theme change while windows are open
- Support of two double quotes inside comments
- Standalone Morphic worlds in separate windows
- StringMorph can now display emphasis underlined (2r100) and strikethrough (2r10000)
- Fix of several memory leaks
- Improve working directory structure (introduction of a `pharo-local` directory to includes Pharo directories as `package-cache`)
- Better autocategorisation of methods
- Introduction of a `FuzzyMatcher` for approximate string matching
- `Glamour` integration in `Spec`
- Renaming (`CMD+R`) in `Nautilus` supports more AST nodes
- `anObject asMethodConst` to cache expressions dynamically
- `GlobalIdentifier` for computer identification
- `NeoUUIDGenerator` replace the old UUIDGenerator
- `STON` was improved and is now used by `Monticello FileTree`
- Storing of suspended announcements 
- Improved `newAnonymousSubclass`
- Inheritable process specific variables
- Fuel improvements
- Enable methods using `<example>` to be easily executed
- Support for `<sampleInstance>`
- New class and methods API for tags as replacement for categories and protocols
- `TabMorph` improvements
- faster source code fetching from .changes & .sources
- Unify `Dictionary` APIs
- Package manifests improvements
- Improve `RadioButton` groups

### Cleanups

- `Object>>#name` is now deprecated and will be removed in Pharo 7
- Tab, TabBar, TabManager, and LockableTab renamed with a Morph postfix
- Better system modularization
- Ability of the system to be fully bootstrapped from source codes
- Turn of catalog search in `Spotter` by default (This improve the stability of Pharo under poor internet connection)
- Remove `Chroma-CubeHelix` and `TxWorkspace`
- Rename `Pragma>>#selector` to `Pragma>>#methodSelector`
- Improve icons management (`#iconNmaed:` was introduce to replace DNUs)
- Limit use of `#asClass` in order to rely on an environment
- It is now possible to give a rewrite rule when deprecating a method to automatically rewrite code with deprecation (`#deprecated:transformWith:`)
- Deprecation of:
    - `Object>>name`
    - `ShortRunArray` class
    - `Object>>confirm:orCancel:`
    - `Object>>ifNil:ifNotNilDo:`
    - `Object>>ifNotNilDo:`
    - `Object>>ifNotNilDo:ifNil:`
    - `Collection>>ifEmpty:ifNotEmptyDo:`
    - `Collection>>ifNotEmptyDo:`
    - `Collection>>ifNotEmptyDo:ifEmpty:`
    - `SequenciableCollection>>copyLast:`
    - `Integer>>asBytesDescription`
    -  `Pragma>>method:`

### Unit testing/Documentation

- `RecursionStopper`: It provides an easy way to check if we are in a recursion and execute code just once in a recursion.
- New process specific variable `CurrentExecutionEnvironment` with values: `DefaultExecutionEnvironment` by default and `TestExecutionEnvironment` during test run
- SUnit improvements: time limit for tests, preventing "forked debuggers"
- New assert extension to compare floats by closeTo:
- More class comments and documentation

### Network

- Support `Server Name Indication` (SNI) in `Zodiac/SSLPlugin`
- `Zinc/Zodiac` update
