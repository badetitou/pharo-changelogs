# Pharo 6.0 

A large, international community of developers worked hard for several months to iron out all problems and to make Pharo 6.0 a great release. 
Pharo 6.0 saw a large set of changes, infrastructural improvements and others: more than 1400 tickets got closed. 
Our actions are targeted at building a sound infrastructure on top of which new generation of systems can be built.  
Remember that Pharo is your open-source system!

## New Stuff

- The PharoVM and image is now provided in 64-bit version and brings even better performance and stability
- A new code changes management system named Epica for easier reviewing and recovering of your code
- Integrated support for Git and easy-to-use tool for repositories and commits management named Iceberg (as preview for Pharo 7)
- Unified foreign function interface (UFFI) for interfacing with the outside world was significantly improved
- Introduction of objects immutability, alternative bytecode sets and block closures independent on outer context 
- The whole Pharo is now able to be bootstrapped from source codes managed by Git and Pharo modularity was improved
- The Dark Theme was improved and set as default color theme for Pharo
