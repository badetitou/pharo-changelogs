#Pharo 5.0 

A large, international community of developers worked hard for several months to iron out all problems and to make Pharo 5.0 a great release. Pharo 5.0 saw a large set of changes, infrastructural improvements and others: more than [NUMBER] tickets got closed. Our actions are targeted at building a sound infrastructure on top of which a new generation of systems can be built.  
Remember that Pharo is your open-source system!

New Stuff
---------

- The PharoVM is now based on Spur, the new memory manager, and it brings with it a 35% speedup!
- A new unified foreign function interface (UFFI) replaced NativeBoost to provide a strong Spur-compatible framework for interfacing with the outside world.
- The Glamorous Toolkit now includes the GTDebugger to offer a moldable infrastructure that allows the developer to customize the debugger deeply.
- The underlying Reflectivity mechanism has reached maturity, with multiple pieces coming together to empower developers to instrument their own systems. For example, we now have breakpoints implemented as just a simple extension of this mechanism.
- QualityAssistant is now part of the image to provide live feedback during development.

All Issues
---------
Many changes have been made to support the generation of a more modular system. This release integrates 
quite a large number of fixes and enhancements: more than 2450! List is so big that we cannot put it here 
(it wouldn't make any sense), but you can review all issues at [FogBugz issue tracker](https://pharo.fogbugz.com) (you will need an account there, sorry). 

Thank you all for your contribution.
